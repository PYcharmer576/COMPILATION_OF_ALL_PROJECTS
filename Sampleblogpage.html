  <p><pre><h3>What the B-2 is</h3>
    The B-2 spirit is a supersonic stealth bomber. it can carry up to 40,000 LBS of  bombs. It  is one of the most popular and powerful bombers in the world.
    
    <h3>Why detecting the B-2 is nearly impossible</h3>
    The B-2 has never been detected on radar but sometimes when a B-2 approaches and opens it's bomb bay a small flicker sometimes appears on radar. 
    
    There are a few reasons why the B-2 almost never appears on radar. The reasons are as listed below:
    <ul shape="disc">
   <li> The engines are covered inside the wing making them less susceptible to enemy heat seeking missiles and radar</li>
    <li>The lack of an afterburner ensures stealth from infrared homing<li></li>
    <li>The composite material used in the B-2 bomber is specifically designed to absorb radio energy with optimum efficiency.</li> 
    <li>Parts of the B-2, such as the leading edge, are also covered in advanced radio-absorbent paint and tape. </li>    
    <li>These materials are very expensive, and the Air Force has to reapply them regularly.</li>
    </ul>
